 Use Keyboard to control the cursor to place the life
Well-known patterns of Game of Life to select from(Examples:Gosper Glider Gun, Glider, Lightweight train).
	// create a list for showing cpatternlst = before confirm
	// set keyboard keys to allow user to place
	// if user clicked another pattern: list clear
	// fill square colors in list
		-> if confirm place: currentBoard update == 1
	//
